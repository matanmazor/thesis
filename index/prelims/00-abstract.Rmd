Representing the absence of things is qualitatively different from representing their presence. Specifically, to represent something as absent one must know that they would have known if it were present. This form of counterfactual reasoning critically relies on having a mental self-model which specifies expected perceptual and cognitive states under different world states. This thesis addresses open questions regarding inference about absence in perceptual decision making: its reliance on prior metacognitive knowledge, relative encapsulation from metacognitive monitoring, neural underpinning, and its relation with default-reasoning and predictive-coding. 

I start with examining inference about absence in visual search, where the timing of decisions about the absence of an item has been shown to be sensitive to search time and accuracy in previous trials. I ask how decisions about the absence of an item are made in the very first trials of the experiment, before previous trials are available. Findings from two behavioural experiments provide evidence that implicit metacognitive knowledge about spatial attention supports inference about the absence of items already in these first trials, and that this implicit knowledge is dissociable from explicit metacognitive knowledge about search difficulty. By analyzing prospective search time estimates, I also show that people's internal models of their visual search behaviour incorporate multiple sources of information, some are person-specific. I then ask what factors contribute to confidence in decisions about presence and absence. 

Previous studies found that subjective confidence in perceptual decisions is mostly sensitive to perceptual evidence supporting the decision, but decisions about stimulus absence are unique in that they are based on the absence of evidence, rendering positive evidence unavailable. Using reverse-correlation I identify stimulus features that contribute to decision confidence in decisions about absence and presence, and discuss these findings in the context of sensory noise estimation. Using functional MRI, I find that a network of frontal and parietal regions that are implicated in decision confidence are mostly invariant to whether subjective confidence is rated with respect to decisions about presence or absence. In interpreting these results, I formulate computational models that monitor fluctuations in external stimulus strength and in internal attentional states. Finally, in a series of six behavioural experiments I show that different levels of the cognitive hierarchy are sensitive to different notions of absence. I conclude with a discussion of specific ways in which inference about absence can be used by cognitive scientists for probing implicit metacognitive beliefs and studying the mental self-model.
