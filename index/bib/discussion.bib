@incollection{helmholtz_concerning_1948,
	address = {East Norwalk, CT, US},
	series = {Century psychology series},
	title = {Concerning the perceptions in general, 1867},
	abstract = {The title of this selection is the subtitle used by Helmholtz in his Physiological Optics in discussing his empirical approach to visual perception. The translation is from the third German edition. It is reprinted by the permission of the Optical Society of America from Helmholtz's Treatise on Physiological Optics, edited by James P. C. Southall, 1925. The sensations aroused by light in the nervous mechanism of vision enable us to form conceptions as to the existence, form and position of external objects. These ideas are called visual perceptions. In this third subdivision of Physiological Optics we must try to analyze the scientific results which we have obtained concerning the conditions which give rise to visual perceptions. Perceptions of external objects being therefore of the nature of ideas, and ideas themselves being invariably activities of our psychic energy, perceptions also can only be the result of psychic energy. Accordingly, strictly speaking, the theory of perceptions belongs properly in the domain of psychology. This is particularly true with respect to the mode of the mental activities in the case of the perceptions and with respect to the determination of their laws. Yet even here there is a wide field of investigation in both physics and physiology, inasmuch as we have to determine, scientifically as far as possible, what special properties of the physical stimulus and of the physiological situation are responsible for the formation of this or that particular idea as to the nature of the external objects perceived. Our main purpose will be simply to investigate the material of sensation whereby we are enabled to form ideas, in those relations that are important for the perceptions obtained from them. This problem can be solved entirely by scientific methods. At the same time, we cannot avoid referring to psychic activities and the laws that govern them, as far as they are concerned with the perception of the senses. I am aware that in the present state of knowledge it is impossible to refute the intuition theory. The reasons why I prefer the opposite view are because in my opinion: 1. The intuition theory is an unnecessary hypothesis; 2. Its consequences thus far invariably apply to perceptual images of space which only in the fewest cases are in accordance with reality and with the correct visual images that are undoubtedly present; and 3. It is not clear how the assumption of these original "space sensations" can help the explanation of our visual perceptions, when the adherents of this theory ultimately have to assume in by far the great majority of cases that these sensations must be overruled by the better understanding which we get by experience. This is by way of justifying my point of view. A choice had to be made simply for the sake of getting at least some sort of superficial order amid the chaos of phenomena; and so I believed I had to adopt the view I have chosen. However, I trust it has not affected the correct observation and description of the facts. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},
